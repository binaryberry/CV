**Available for work as a Junior Developer in London, UK**

I love logical problem-solving and find it very rewarding to build and improve apps and sites. After 7 years working in PR for tech brands such as Eventbrite and Yelp, I decided to go through the looking glass and become a developer myself.

I have just graduated from an intensive 12 week development bootcamp at [Makers Academy] and I am looking forward to finding my first job as a developer.
