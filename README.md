**Available for work as a Junior Developer in London, UK**

I love logical problem-solving and find it very rewarding to build and improve apps and sites. After 7 years working in PR for tech brands such as Eventbrite and Yelp, I decided to go through the looking glass and become a developer myself.

I have just graduated from an intensive 12 week development bootcamp at [Makers Academy] and I am looking forward to finding my first job as a developer. I love working as part of a team, and I want to find a company that embraces Agile methodologies and TDD, and where I can keep developing my skills while contributing to the codebase.

| A world map displaying the historical events that happened on a specific date. The date can be changed using a slider, and each event is represented by a marker on the map with a pop up that provides more information. Built using Ruby, Sinatra, Javascript and postgres.| A Sinatra website allowing users to store links to their favorite websites, built during week 5 at Makers Academy. Taught me to use databases (postgres with datamapper) and user sessions.| A model of the 'Boris Bikes' bike hire scheme in London, built in Ruby during week 2 and 3 at Makers Academy, my first introduction to OOD and SOLID principles.|

Previous Employment
----------

####*Eventbrite*
PR Manager France: June 2013&mdash;December 2013

I helped Eventbrite get press coverage in France, and got them to be mentionned in the French equivalents of Reuters, the Times and the Financial Times (by this I mean AFP, Le Monde, Les Echos).

####*AXA Life Invest*
PR, Research and Digital Marketing Manager: January 2012&mdash;December 2012

I managed the company's French and UK PR agencies, and led a couple of interesting market research projects carried out by Experian and SIMALTO specialist Research For Today that allowed us to improve our distribution network. I also coordinated the company's social media efforts which saw its Facebook page rise from 40 to 1000 (relevant) followers.

####*Hopscotch Système Europe*
Senior Consultant: December 2006&mdash;December 2011

During my time in public relations, I led international campaigns for a wide variety of companies, often having to familiarise myself with their sectors. Some tech companies I've worked for during my time there: Yelp, 9flats (competitor of Airbnb), Solocal (web solutions for SMB), BDNA (IT Asset Management Software).

Here are some transferable skills I have acquired:
- Organisational Skills: multitasking, prioritising tasks, setting deadlines
- Communication Skills: presenting and sharing ideas in a clear way
- Team player: delivering constructive feedback, offering help, being generally enthusiastic
- Attention to detail: I am a card-carrying typo destroyer

Education
-----------
 * (2000-2006) Master in Marketing and Customer Relations from Audencia Nantes Management School and Lycée Vilgénis.
 Included a one-year internship in a movie festival organisation.

I also like...
----------------
- Game of Thrones - I organised a quiz night last June where guests where encouraged to fancy dress, and build a model of the iron throne using toothpicks, play-doh and kitchen foil. I presented the evening in costume, drafted the quiz questions, prepared large banners with the House's sigils, and promoted the event online. People were very happy!
- Crossfit - a fitness programme that aims at being complete and varied: endurance, strength, speed and more! Tough but they have a great community and spirit.
- Yoga
- Juicing - that lovely apple, pineapple, celeri and kale juice... nutritious and delicious!
- Excel sheets - I use them to organise my trips, handle people's feedback, organise parties... for a lot of different things. The day I spent fiddling with Google sheet formulas and forms to create a sales leads email generator was the day I realised I really needed to get serious about learning to code.
